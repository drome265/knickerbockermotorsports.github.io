										<h2>KMR-2015</h2>
									</header>
		
										<p>The KMR-15 was an evolution of the successful KMR-14. The chassis was made lighter, suspension geometry was improved, drivetrain was refined, and in-house carbon fiber panels were made.  This year also marked the first time the team attended two competitions, as well as its first participation in an international competition, Formula North.  At FSAE Michigan, the team placed 35th in Autocross, placing our car in the top third of competing teams as well as making it Columbia's best autocross finish ever. Finally, there was much growth in the team. Columbia had an extended team of over 50 members, and received a donation of a diesel tow truck.</p>
