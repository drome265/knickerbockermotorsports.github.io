										<h2>KMR-2014</h2>
									</header>
										<p>The KMR-14 will hold its place in history as Columbia's best looking car, sporting the world famous Martini-Racing livery, a carbon fiber body, a perfect sparkling red powder coated frame, and anodized aluminum parts. In terms of performance, the car was the first to have the engine as a stressed member. The car provided launch control and featured Hyperworks optimization of suspension components. The KMR-14 completed the grueling endurance section of FSAE Lincoln, and gave Columbia its best competition finish ever at 35th place overall. 2014 brought on some key sponsors, including EVS Metal, Coastal Enterprises, and Tri-Power.</p>
